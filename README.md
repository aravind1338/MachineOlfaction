# MachineOlfaction
Code associated with the machine olfaction research project. Will add more stuff soon


flavornet_webscraper.py:

* To extract the dataset from flavornets.org, I copied the source HTML (right click, view frame source) and used a webscraper to get the dataset.
* Running it once will give you flavornet_dataset.csv, a CSV file that mimics the website along with the SMILES representation of the molecules.
